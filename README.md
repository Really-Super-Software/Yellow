# Yellow
## Description
Yellow is a programming language designed and coded by donovan-maker. It uses c like syntax, but has no middle man file like c does and is more like python. It has been a project I have been planning for a little bit, but never took it real for a while. Then I learnt how to make an actual PL (Programming Language) and then remade Yellow. <br>
Why I chose the name Yellow isn't really known, in fact I don't even know why I named it that, but it fits it and I feel as though it's also funny that it's file extention is `.yell`.
## How to use
During the prereleases (current versions) all you have to do is run `python main.py` and it will open the repl, but in later versions, beta is planned for this, you will have to specify a source file.
